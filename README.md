### Hi there 👋

In 2019, I left my career in architecture in Buenos Aires to pursue my passion for coding. My journey began in Portugal, where I immersed myself in mastering programming languages. It quickly became evident that I prefer creating code over designing condos.

Since then, I have thrived in dynamic startup environments, gaining extensive experience with cutting-edge Web3 technologies. I am adept at delivering high-quality solutions, using data analytics to drive decisions and optimize product performance. My unique combination of design, coding, and analytical skills enables me to seamlessly bridge the gap between design and development, resulting in user-friendly, efficient products.
