### Hi there 👋

I left my architecture projects in Buenos Aires, my hometown, and followed my desire to learn how to code. As soon as I sat through my first programming bootcamp in Portugal, I fell in love with creating code instead of condos. 

I thrive when working in international environments and love getting to know new cultures. Just ask me about the time I lived in Brazil, Spain, Costa Rica or Argentina. Devoted to surfing, my relationship with the ocean is a constant reminder of the ebbs and flows of life.
